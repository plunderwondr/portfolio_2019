                      Working with the event organizer, the goal was to make an accessible webpage for people to learn about the event with a few special requirements 
                      including embedded streams for 6 different streams, and displaying all the celebrity guests in an easy to digest method. The organizer found a couple 
                      templates -- assembling a mood board, and we went with the one that had most of the visual components implemented.

                    Originally a school co-op -- I aquired a full-time position at Ubique(previous parent company) creating a mockup for implementing a League of Legends
                     tournament system. When I had first arrived they had implemented Minecraft tournaments and were just finishing up automated CS:GO tournaments. 
                     Having recently worked with the League API -- I knew that there was secretly a way to implement automated tournaments to the spec that Swarmio 
                     required.

                      <b>API Access Restrictions:</b> 
                      With only a one month trial period, it was impossible to receive production access to api keys before that deadline.
                      So I had to make a functional development build to show off the theoretical functionality & Design of the tournament system and hope that would be enough to continue with this project in a prolongued contract.

                    <li class="li">
                      <b>Lack of guidelines & resources:</b>
                      As a small startup company, Ibuque did not have a clear focal point in mind. Before I came up with the idea for the website my co-op guide was "figure out how to make something we can use"
                      given access to the git directory and left to figure it out without impacting main website development. Working on something for weeks to find out that it's not in the companies direct interest can be stressful.
                      In the end the secret was just adapting to the work environment and realising that no one cared if you made mistakes as long as you were there to help solve problems in a timely manner when you were needed.

                    Shortly after arriving at Swarmio we started running weekly tournaments that required technical staff to be working to be managed as the tournament structure 
                    was still being tested & implemented (hence the tournaments). So a fellow co-worker and I developed the Admin tools -- allowing less technically inclined staff
                     to make changes to values in the database in a safe manner.

                      Therefore knowing what was going to be released on the main website was important and knowing the difficulty of that task allowed some features to be useful even after implenetation on the main website.

                      <b>Scope:</b>Admin tools could have been a straight substitute for the website for an employee to use, but this was a side-task for both of the developers on it that wasn't 
                      heavily endorsed originally. Therefore time spent had to be crucial to saving time overall (and in immediate future!) to prove towards management that it was a worth while endeavor. 
                      In the end admin tools cut my weekly workload in half and let me work remotely during events.

                  Vile was a "2.5D" game (Sprite  based beat'em up with 3 dimensional movement), design based off of a previous text based project. As producer/sound designer for this project

                      With obligations of design elements being implemented without input by our studio, a lot of creative choice was stripped from the studio. This can definetly be seen in the 
                      varing quality on stages and other element quality control issues. Given the circumstances the overall results was about what could be expected, but in the future I would of tried 
                      to implement a system to motivate workers instead of a simple trust based system. In addition not letting the strangehold of design decision overhead eat at us, tried to push past them 
                      by doing the bare minimum for them so we could focus on what we wanted instead --creating a good game.

                      With a 3 month deadline and an unexperienced team already working full time not including the project made it hard to get meetings to happen, expect progress from individuals and meet any deadlines I had implemented.
                      What had seemed like a very casual project development plan, had turned out to be slightly ambitious and lead to not enough time left in the parts we were most excited for -- polish (game refinement).

                    Techno Beats was the second video game project that I was producer for. This game partiicularily was a big project for me as I was working with people I barely knew, 
                    and wanted to prove to myself I could lead a successful game project. We landed on making a bullet hell game with game mechanics centered around the music, which landed really well with me, inspiring me to continually work harder.

                        <B>Co-workers:</B> 
                        This year working with people that were not yet friends, we all had to learn about each others strengths and weaknessess. 
                        Unfortunately, I had not forseen a co-worker feeling like they had to steal others work to complete assignments and make due dates. 
                        This meant a month's labor from this person had to be thrown out because we couldn't tell what had been copied and what was orginal ideas.
                        Later in the year we lost our lead programmer because they wanted to join a more ambitious project, and due to my poor decisions, we were left
                         with sections of code that were unparsable to the team as I had given the lead programmer lots of creative leeway to maintain there interest in a project 
                         that they were not very interested in (Their game idea was not chosen for our project). Our team suffered from my choices and we were left with a difficult to work with mess to work with.
