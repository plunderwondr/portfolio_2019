                    Working with the event organizer, the goal was to make an accessible webpage for people to learn about the event with a few special requirements 
                    including embedded streams for 6 different streams, and displaying all the celebrity guests in an easy to digest method. The organizer found a couple 
                    templates -- assembling a mood board, and we went with the one that had most of the visual components implemented.

                      to avoid in the future.

                  Originally a school co-op -- I aquired a full-time position at Ubique(previous parent company) creating a mockup for implementing a League of Legends
                   tournament system. When I had first arrived they had implemented Minecraft tournaments and were just finishing up automated CS:GO tournaments. 
                   Having recently worked with the League API -- I knew that there was secretly a way to implement automated tournaments to the spec that Swarmio 
                   required.

                    <b>API Access Restrictions:</b> 
                    With only a one month trial period, it was impossible to receive production access to api keys before that deadline.
                    So I had to make a functional development build to show off the theoretical functionality & Design of the tournament system and hope that would be enough to continue with this project in a prolongued contract.

                    <b>Lack of guidelines & resources:</b>
                    As a small startup company, Ibuque did not have a clear focal point in mind. Before I came up with the idea for the website my co-op guide was "figure out how to make something we can use"
                    given access to the git directory and left to figure it out without impacting main website development. Working on something for weeks to find out that it's not in the companies direct interest can be stressful.
                    In the end the secret was just adapting to the work environment and realising that no one cared if you made mistakes as long as you were there to help solve problems in a timely manner when you were needed.

                Vile was a "2.5D" game (Sprite  based beat'em up with 3 dimensional movement), design based off of a previous text based project. As producer/sound designer for this project
                 it was my duty to distribute tasks, make sure everyone understood those tasks, lead team meetings, and pick up any tasks were extra development effort was required.

                    With obligations of design elements being implemented without input by our studio, a lot of creative choice was stripped from the studio. This can definetly be seen in the 
                    varing quality on stages and other element quality control issues. Given the circumstances the overall results was about what could be expected, but in the future I would of tried 
                    to implement a system to motivate workers instead of a simple trust based system. In addition not letting the strangehold of design decision overhead eat at us, tried to push past them 
                    by doing the bare minimum for them so we could focus on what we wanted instead --creating a good game.

                    With a 3 month deadline and an unexperienced team already working full time not including the project made it hard to get meetings to happen, expect progress from individuals and meet any deadlines I had implemented.
                    What had seemed like a very casual project development plan, had turned out to be slightly ambitious and lead to not enough time left in the parts we were most excited for -- polish (game refinement).
